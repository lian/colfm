= colfm - a console, column-oriented file manager

colfm is a new, lightweight file manager written in Ruby with
FFI::Ncurses.  It is based on ideas of NeXTSTEP's File Viewer,
the OS X Finder, Emacs dired, vifm, and Midnight Commander.

== Installation

Ruby 1.8 and 1.9 are supported.

    gem install ffi ffi-ncurses
    cp colfm.rb ~/bin
    cat colfm.zsh >>~/.zshrc        # or better source it

== Usage

colfm displays the path to the current directory in columns.  The
right-most column is the currently active and is displayed in more
detail (shows file sizes).

== Command cheatsheet

    j k  Up Down      move selection up/down
    h    Left         go to parent column
    l F3 Right Enter  enter directory/view file
    J K  Next Prev    scroll up/down by half a screen
    g    Home         move to first file
    G    End          move to last file
    /  C-s            enter I-search, find file by regular expression:
    /   Right         enter selected directory
    ..  Left          go to parent

    .  ~              toggle display of dotfiles, backup files
    s                 toggle sorting (name, extension, size, atime, ctime, mtime)
    S                 reverse sorting
    v                 toggle sidebar preview

    n                 open directory in new tab
    N                 close current tab
    t TAB  T S-TAB    next/previous tab

    E                 open file in vim
    O                 open file

    m  SPC            mark/unmark selected file
    %                 enter I-select, mark files by regular expression
    c                 clear list of marked files
    V                 list marked files
    C  F5             copy marked files into current directory (cp -a)
    M  F6             move marked files into current directory (mv)
    +  F7             create new directory (mkdir -p)
    X  F8             remove marked files recursively (rm -rf)

    !                 run shell command:
        TAB               insert currently selected file
        S-TAB             insert currently marked files
    C-l  C-r          refresh display
    q  F10  C-o       quit colfm

All prompts can be canceled with ESC or C-g and support primitive
editing with C-w and C-u in classical Unix manner.

== ZSH integration

After loading colfm.zsh, you can:

* quickly toggle between shell and colfm by pressing C-o
* use "ccd" to change the directory with colfm
* use "cargs" as a shortcut for xargs on the marked files
* use "csel" to list the currently marked files, or pipe to csel to set them

== AVFS support

If you want to browse various file archives or access remote file
systems, colfm supports the AVFS fuse daemon:

    avfsmount
    colfm.rb ~/src/ruby-1.8.7-p249.tar.gz      # transparent
    colfm.rb ~/.avfs/#ftp:ftp.ruby-lang.org/   # direct
